<h1> DAILY BLOG!</h1>
<hr><br><br><br>
<p>Hello Everybody, My name is Atharv Singh And this is day 1 of my blog. Today was an exciting day at school I had quite a few assignments however I was able to complete them with ease only a few of us were present today we did learn some new topics but we didn't have any pop tests which was kind of disappointing as I was hoping we would have some since I had prepared the previous night for the test, we are going to my friends home for dinner me and my friend love playing the game Minecraft we want to try out a new mechanism in the game today I have been catching up on quite a bit of reading as well. I finished the famous series(It ends with us and It starts with us) of new york bestselling author colleen hoover, I am currently reading the book l November 9th and you can expect a book review for all of them quite soon on this website, I plan also to read the Thriller Verity I have heard its quite an amazing read.  </p>
